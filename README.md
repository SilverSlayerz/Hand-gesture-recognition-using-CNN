# Hand-gesture-recognition-using-CNN
Implemented a deep learning model to recognize American Sign Language hand gestures using CNN. The project involved designing and training a CNN on grayscale image datasets (28x28 pixels) to classify 26 alphabetic gestures. Regularization techniques and visualization methods were employed to enhance performance and interpret model behavior.
